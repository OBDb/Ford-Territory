    description: "The original Ford Territory was a mid-size SUV developed by Ford Australia, based on the locally designed and built Falcon platform. This unique approach resulted in a rear-wheel or all-wheel drive SUV with car-like handling characteristics uncommon in SUVs of its era. Initially powered by a 4.0L inline-six engine with either naturally aspirated or turbocharged variants, a 2.7L V6 diesel sourced from Land Rover was added in 2011. The interior featured innovative 'Territory Command Driving Position' with excellent visibility and numerous family-friendly storage solutions, including a removable bin under the center console. Available in five or seven-seat configurations across various trim levels from the basic TX to the luxury Ghia, it offered features uncommon in Australian-developed vehicles. A significant update in 2011 (SZ) refreshed the styling, improved refinement, and introduced the diesel engine option. The Territory was a significant success for Ford Australia, winning numerous awards and addressing the growing SUV market while leveraging local engineering expertise. Production ended in 2016 with the closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing operations."

    description: "The current Territory, unrelated to the Australian model, is a compact crossover SUV developed for emerging markets, primarily China, through a joint venture with Jiangling Motors (JMC). Based on the JMC Yusheng S330, it features Ford's global design language with a prominent grille, sleek headlights, and conventional crossover proportions. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 1.5L EcoBoost turbocharged gasoline engine or a 48V mild hybrid system in some regions. The interior represents a significant focus area with a modern design featuring a floating touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument options, and contemporary connectivity features. Available in five-seat configuration only, it emphasizes value with competitive feature content at its price point. This generation represents Ford's strategy of developing market-specific products for regions like China, South America, and parts of Asia, leveraging partnerships to create cost-effective vehicles tailored to local requirements. Unlike the Australian Territory which was a domestically engineered premium product, this model focuses on affordability and technology features important to emerging market consumers."
